*Shader will utilize the world lighting if there is a world light, or will switch to its own internal shading automatically if there isn't one.*


So with Granblue on the horizon, I wanted to remake my Arc System shader completely from the ground up. Much better colors, actually added in the vertex colors because I was lazy before, and finalized my system that I started working on to automatically switch between a fake light direction if there is no world light source, and the real light direction if there is one.
I've scrapped the other versions as they are basically worthless now.

Also if you arent aware, I have a much larger release of shaders on my main github shader page which can be found here:
