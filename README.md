*Shader will utilize the world lighting if there is a world light, or will switch to its own internal shading automatically if there isn't one.*


So with Granblue on the horizon, I wanted to remake my Arc System shader completely from the ground up. Much better colors, actually added in the vertex colors because I was lazy before, and finalized my system that I started working on to automatically switch between a fake light direction if there is no world light source, and the real light direction if there is one.
I've scrapped the other versions as they are basically worthless now.
