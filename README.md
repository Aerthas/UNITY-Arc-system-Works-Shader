## DISCLAIMER:
So this shader is made with ZERO teachings, and everything I know about shaders is self taught over the last year and half. I know some colors might be off, such as the highlight fresnel color, but I am actively trying to figure out how the game does it. If you have ANY information about how a specific thing should be differently to make it look better please do not hesitate to [join my discord specifically for this shader.](https://discord.gg/EkCSZg8)<br/><br/>
Secondary note: Yes, if you are animating something (or using VRChat), the colors will look right under normal light but might not look right if you are trying to do something such as having a point light in your hand to emulate a kamehameha. Arc System Games do not actually light in "real time" per se, but every single option of the shader is MANUALLY edited frame by frame by the art team as they make animations. If you want something to look PERFECT during an animation, you need to put in just as much work as the original art team did. I'll keep trying to make it easy to work with, but there MUST be a lot of variables.
